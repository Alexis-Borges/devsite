        <ul>
            <li> 1st Place Exchange <strong> Binance. </strong></li>
            <li> Binance is the best rated exchange in the world with a notation surronding 9.8 in satisfaction, my rating for Binance Exchange would be a &#x2B50 &#x2B50 &#x2B50 &#x2B50 &#x2B50 notation.</li>
            <li> The Best part in this exchange is clearly the taxes, the charges never exceeds 0.1% which is nothing when withdrawing your funds or for an transaction.</li> 
        </ul>

    <div>
        <nav class="secondelist">
            <img src="images/coinbase.png" title="Coinbase" class="coinbase" >
            <ul>
                <li> 2nd Place Exchange <strong> Coinbase. </strong> </li>
                <li> Coinbase have more users then binance and he was one of the first but binance gained so much rating from the users by getting a good usersupport and by add low taxes.</li>
                <li> Witch from coinbase is they worst advantage cuz coinbase have commonly bug and problems with usersupport thats why if you just want the "mainstream" Exchange.</li>
            </ul>
